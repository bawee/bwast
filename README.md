# bwast
Performs blast comparisons using genbank files

Description
--------------
Script to run blast on Genbank/EMBL files without having to first convert to fasta. 

Cool features: 
------------------
* Allows subregion of genbank or fasta file to be specified
* Allows loading of files into Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)


Cut and converted files will be written into the same directory as the file specified in the arguments, NOT the current working directory.
